# Hero Section Project

This project is a small demonstration of a **Hero Section** with modern animations. It leverages React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion to create a responsive and interactive section for a webpage.

## Overview

- **Hero Section:** Includes an introductory emoji and text, a main heading, an underline, and CTA buttons.
- **Animated Cards:** A background rectangle and multiple cards that animate into view when scrolled into the viewport.
- **Hover Effects:** Cards scale up and raise their z-index on hover, giving a dynamic feel.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using responsive Tailwind CSS classes.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the component structure.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling and ensuring responsiveness.
- **Framer Motion:** For smooth animations and interactive hover effects.
- **Intersection Observer API:** To trigger animations when elements enter or leave the viewport.
